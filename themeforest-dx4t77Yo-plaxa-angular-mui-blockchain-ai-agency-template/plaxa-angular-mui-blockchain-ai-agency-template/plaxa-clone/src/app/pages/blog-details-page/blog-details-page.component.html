                Over the past three years, marketers have faced an arduous journey due to the rapid shifts in consumer sentiment and the rising costs associated with their trade. In an era of economic uncertainty, shoppers have been compelled to prioritize value, leading to a trend of downgrading their purchases. In fact, our March 2023 survey revealed that a staggering 80 percent of consumers are modifying their shopping behavior by either adjusting the quantity or pack size of their purchases or opting to switch brands and retailers in search of more affordable options.

Many believe they can manage such measures by simply spending less. While they may be confident about their ability to achieve savings, they are less assured when it comes to driving growth. According to our December survey, two out of three respondents expressed apprehension about simultaneously reducing spending and outperforming competitors.
